# pwcSentimentStocks

This repository is going to be used for the Hack2Innovate hackathon.

**Problem Statement:** Sentiment in the social media (facebook, twitter, instagram, linkedin etc.) plays a big role in managing the perception of an organisation. This sentiment can have an impact in the stock price of listed companies. Is there a statistically significant correlation (or even a lagged correlation) between the social media sentiment and the stock price. This will give the corporate communications department a very important tool to monitor the leading indicator (social media sentiment) in order to estimate the lagging indicator (stock price).
